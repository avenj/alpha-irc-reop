NAME
    Alpha::IRC::Reop - Automatically manage idle IRC chanops

SYNOPSIS
      use POE;
      use Alpha::IRC::Reop;
      use Alpha::IRC::Reop::Config;

      my $alpha = Alpha::IRC::Reop->new(
        debug  => 0,
        config => Alpha::IRC::Reop::Config->from_file( $cfg_path ),
      );

      $poe_kernel->run;

DESCRIPTION
    Joins configured channels and begins monitoring opped users.

    If a user does not speak for a configurable amount of time, a configured
    'DownSequence' is executed, or mode "-o+v" is set if a DownSequence is
    not specified. When the user resumes activity on the channel, an
    'UpSequence' is executed, or mode "+o-v" is set.

    External mode changes are trusted to be authoritative; if a user is
    opped by external means, we begin monitoring them for activity. If a
    user is deopped by external means, we trust the change and do not reop.

    See Alpha::IRC::Reop::Config for configuration-related details.
